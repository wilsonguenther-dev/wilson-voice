/**
 * Yap (wilson-voice) Overhaul — CI/CD build loop. TEMPLATE (2026-09-12).
 * Ported from the sibling project's loop harness (scripts/loop/template.mjs there). Same machinery, same
 * gates, same halt semantics; the repo, the work dirs and the GATE COMMANDS are Yap's.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS NOT RUN. It is the template that scripts/loop/build.mjs stamps into the PART
 * scripts scripts/loop/generated/part-NN.mjs (a thin scripts/cicd-loop-all.mjs then runs those
 * parts in order, because the Workflow tool refuses any single script over 524288 bytes):
 *     node scripts/loop/build.mjs          (or: npm run loop:build, from desktop/)
 * Exactly four markers are substituted, and nothing else is:
 *     the __META__ marker  -> the generated `export const meta` literal (Recon, one phase per
 *                             item, Drain, Reflect). It is a PURE LITERAL and the file's FIRST
 *                             statement, which is what the Workflow tool requires.
 *     the __ITEMS__ marker -> the concatenated ITEMS.push({...}) statements from
 *                             scripts/loop/items/NN-<group>.mjs, in filename order. One part
 *                             gets a consecutive run of WHOLE item files, never a split file.
 *     the __KEEP_WORKTREE__ marker -> `true` for every part but the last, `false` for the last.
 *     the __LANES__ marker -> item id -> lane index, round-robin over the SOURCE ITEM FILES.
 * Edit THIS file to change the harness. Edit scripts/loop/items/*.mjs to change the work.
 * Never hand-edit scripts/cicd-loop-all.mjs or scripts/loop/generated/*.mjs — every build
 * overwrites them.
 *
 * The GENERATED file is run via the Claude Code `Workflow` tool with {scriptPath: <it>}.
 * It is NOT a node module — top-level await/return are correct there and a `node --check`
 * will flag them. Ignore that. (build.mjs IS a node module and does pass node --check.)
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS HARNESS IS, AND WHY ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. REPO is the PUBLIC repo `wilsonguenther-dev/wilson-voice`. The app lives in `desktop/`:
 *    a Cargo workspace (src-tauri + yap-polish) plus a Vite/React frontend. There is no web
 *    backend, no database and no hosted production surface in this loop — the shipped article
 *    is a notarized macOS DMG, and building one takes minutes, so the DMG is NOT in the
 *    per-item gate. It belongs to a final smoke item.
 * 2. THE GATE IS LOCAL BY DEFAULT. GitHub Actions is dead account-wide on a spending limit and
 *    the newest run on this repo is weeks old, so `scripts/loop/ci-mode.mjs` resolves UNKNOWN to
 *    `local` on purpose: the local gate is strictly stronger than the CI gate (the acting agent
 *    runs every gate command itself and pastes the bare exit codes on the PR). Recon measures it
 *    once per part and the answer is threaded into every later prompt.
 * 3. WORKDIR is a git WORKTREE of the real checkout (shared object store), not a clone, and its
 *    CARGO_TARGET_DIR is pinned OUTSIDE the worktree so the (expensive, vendored-ggml) Rust build
 *    cache survives every item and every part. Loop clones with an install per item and no
 *    teardown reached 26 clones / 78 GB on the previous project. Drain tears everything down.
 * 4. PRE-FLIGHT PER ITEM. Every item carries `preflight`: the exact commands that, if they ALL
 *    pass on unmodified origin/main, mean the item is ALREADY DONE. The build agent runs them
 *    FIRST, on a detached head, before branching. An already-done item skips review and merge.
 * 5. GATED ITEMS. An item with `gated: 'panel'` dispatches no agent at all until its id appears
 *    in args.panelApproved. Senior Panel first, code second.
 * 6. ONE THROWN STAGE MUST NOT KILL A 24-HOUR RUN. Every item is wrapped in try/catch: the error
 *    is logged, the item is recorded as errored, and the lane continues. A HALT is different.
 * 7. The independent review gate is a SECOND OPUS ADVERSARIAL REVIEWER with a DIFFERENT LENS
 *    (liveness / failure polarity / data-and-permission integrity / claim-vs-diff), never a
 *    third-party model. Two reviewers that share a premise are one reviewer.
 *
 * ── Harness lessons encoded ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  D1  advisory notes go on the SAME PR being merged — never a new PR
 *  D2  a DRAIN phase enumerates and triages EVERY open PR, not just ours
 *  D3  superseded PRs/branches are CLOSED with evidence, not left to rot
 *  D4  merge/fix agents rebase onto main BEFORE evaluating checks, every time
 *  D5  merge agents get effort 'high' (they rebase and re-run the whole gate)
 *  D8  final self-audit reports open_prs_before vs after; growth = failure
 *  3a  post both verdicts as REAL `gh pr review` bodies BEFORE merge
 *  3b  self-audit counts state==OPEN from `gh` only — never branch names
 *  3c  sweep branches whose head is an ancestor of main
 *  R1  every gh call carries -R $REPO; the repo is pinned, never inferred
 *  R3  fixRounds is COUNTED from the loop log, never asserted by an agent
 *  --  a BLOCK with an empty blocking[] is malformed → recorded as PASS + advisory
 *  --  agent() === null means the ACCOUNT stopped: retry 3x, then HALT the run
 *  --  TWO BUILDER LANES, no reviewer in the build pass. No agent spawns agents, ever.
 *
 * ── MODE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * args.mode selects the pass; it defaults to 'build'.
 *   'build'  — TWO BUILDER LANES and nothing else. No reviewer, no fix, no merge agent is
 *              dispatched. Each lane owns a worktree, a cargo target dir and a preview port and
 *              walks ITS OWN items: LAND, PRE-FLIGHT, BUILD, open the PR, next item. It never
 *              awaits the other lane and it never waits for CI.
 *   'review' — the SAME script run again afterwards with args {mode:'review'}, and ONLY part-01
 *              runs it: the pass is PR-DRIVEN. One TRIAGE agent turns the open loop-build PRs into
 *              an ordered queue (closing duplicates and superseded work first), then TWO REVIEW
 *              CHAINS consume that shared queue under a HARD CAP OF THREE CONCURRENT AGENTS.

const GUARD = (dir) => `
GUARDRAILS (HARD):
- Do NOT spawn subagents. You are the only agent on this task. Never use the Agent, Task or
  Workflow tools. Never delegate.
- Cap yourself at 60 tool calls. If you run out, push what you have and report honestly what is
  incomplete. A truthful partial result beats a confident fabrication.
- Every single gh command carries -R ${REPO}. Never infer the repo from a remote, never run gh
  from a directory whose origin you have not checked.
- Work ONLY in ${dir}. Never write to ${LOCAL_REPO} — that is Wilson's live checkout and this
  loop does not touch its working tree. ${dir} is a git worktree of it, so they share one
  object store: a commit you make in ${dir} is visible there, but its checkout stays clean.
- This run has TWO lane worktrees, TWO cargo target dirs and TWO preview ports. Touch ONLY the
  ones named above. Never cd into, reset, reinstall or remove another lane's worktree, never
  build into another lane's target dir, and never kill a listener on a port you were not given:
  another agent is using it right now, and its evidence is not yours to break.
- Never report success you have not observed. "Compiled" is not "pushed" is not "merged" is not
  "shipped" is not "works for a human". Verify the positive condition, not the absence of error.
- NEVER read an exit code through a pipe. 'cmd | tail' reports TAIL's status, not cmd's. Use
  'set -o pipefail', or redirect to a file and check $? on the bare command. There is no
  'timeout' binary on macOS.
- cargo check is NOT cargo test, cargo test is NOT a running app, and a green build is NOT a
  working UI. Say which of those you actually did.
- IRREVERSIBLE, NEVER TOUCH: the app's bundle identifier and its data directory. Renaming the
  bundle id resets macOS TCC and the user loses Microphone / Accessibility / Input Monitoring
  grants; renaming the data dir orphans the SQLite history. Do not "tidy" either one, in any item.
`

const COMMIT_CONTRACT = `
COMMITTING — this repo has NO pre-commit hook (core.hooksPath is unset and there is no .githooks).
    git add -A && git commit -m "<id>: <title>"
Do NOT export a QA-ack environment variable — the sibling repo's pre-commit hook demands one and
this repo has no hooks path set at all, so an ack here asserts nothing. NEVER use --no-verify (there is nothing to bypass, so reaching for it only hides a future hook). Commit only
AFTER the acceptance evidence named below actually exists, and never commit a build artifact:
desktop/target, desktop/node_modules, desktop/src-tauri/binaries and desktop/dist are generated.
Check 'git status --porcelain' before you commit and name anything surprising in the PR body.
`

const WORKTREE_CONTRACT = (dir, port, target, other) => `
THE WORK DIR IS A SHARED WORKTREE, NOT YOUR CLONE — AND THERE ARE TWO OF THEM.
This loop runs TWO LANES side by side. YOUR LANE IS:
    WORKDIR           ${dir}
    APP DIRECTORY     ${dir}/${APP}          <- every build command runs HERE, never at the root
    CARGO_TARGET_DIR  ${target}
    PREVIEW PORT      ${port}
The other lane (${other}) belongs to a DIFFERENT item that another agent is building RIGHT NOW.
Never cd into it, never check out a branch in it, never kill a server on its port, never remove it.

EXPORT THE TARGET DIR IN EVERY SHELL THAT RUNS CARGO:
    export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${target}
It lives outside the worktree so the vendored-ggml build cache survives every item and every part.
Forgetting it means a COLD build inside the worktree: minutes you did not need to spend, and a
1.4 GB directory that dies with the worktree.

IGNORE ANY OTHER WORKDIR, TARGET DIR OR PORT NAMED BELOW THIS LINE. Item text may hard-code
${WORKDIR}, ${CARGO_TARGET_A} and port ${PREVIEW_PORT}; wherever it does, read ${dir}, ${target}
and ${port}. This substitution is not optional: two lanes on one port or one target dir is two
builds fighting over one lock, and the evidence you gathered would be the other item's.

Both lanes are worktrees of ${LOCAL_REPO}, created once in Recon with one 'npm ci' and one warm
cargo build each, and every item reuses them. Therefore:
- Start in YOUR lane: cd ${dir} && git fetch origin && git checkout -B <branch> origin/main
- Do not 'rm -rf' it, do not re-clone it, and do not run 'npm ci' again unless
  ${APP}/package-lock.json changed on main (say so if you do).
- Do not create additional worktrees or clones. Disk hygiene is a hard rule: a previous loop left
  26 clones / 78 GB behind on another repo.
- Leave the branch pushed. Drain removes BOTH worktrees at the end of the run.
`

const LOGLINE = (who, itemId, laneStage, extra) => `
BEFORE YOU RETURN, TWO APPENDS. Both are mandatory, and neither may contain a credential.
1. Append one line to ${LOG} with a shell append (mkdir -p its dir first):
   "- ${who} — <what you actually did> — <PR# or sha or NONE> — <outcome in one clause>"
2. Write your row on the run's LIVE STATUS BOARD (${STATUS_BOARD}):
   node ${STATUS} ${itemId} ${laneStage} "<one clause: the state this item is in>" <PR number or omit>${extra ? ` ${extra}` : ''}
   THE ONE CLAUSE MUST CONTAIN "ci=local" OR "ci=github" — whichever gate this run is using (Recon
   published it; scripts/loop/ci-mode.mjs re-derives it in one command if you are unsure). A board
   row that does not say which gate a merge passed cannot be audited after the run, and this run
   is expected to be merging with no CI check to point at.
   The stage argument is LANE-PREFIXED on purpose — "A:", "B:", "review:", "harness:" — so two lanes
   writing at the same moment can never overwrite each other's column. The script UPSERTS one row
   per item: calling it repeatedly is correct and never duplicates a row.
The reflection agent reads ${LOG} as the run's durable record, and Wilson reads the board while the
run is live. Skip either and your work is invisible the moment this session dies.

/**
 * REACHABILITY, Tauri edition. The failure it exists to stop is the same one that shipped five
 * "fixes" into dead modules on the previous project: code that compiles, passes every test, and
 * is reached by nothing.
 */
const REACHABILITY = `
REACHABILITY IS A HARD GATE, CHECKED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. A GREEN BUILD IS NOT REACHABILITY.
This app has three separate ways for a change to be dead on arrival, and tsc, vitest, clippy and
cargo test are all blind to every one of them:

(a) A RUST COMMAND NOBODY CAN CALL. A new #[tauri::command] must be listed in the
    tauri::generate_handler! invocation, or the frontend's invoke() fails at runtime while
    everything compiles. Prove it:
        git grep -n "<command_name>" -- ${APP}/src-tauri/src | grep -i generate_handler
    and name the frontend call site that invokes it.
(b) A FRONTEND MODULE NOBODY IMPORTS. desktop/ has MORE THAN ONE HTML ENTRY (index.html and
    float.html, see vite.config.ts). A module reached from neither entry is dead code:
        git grep -n "<symbol>" -- ${APP}/src | grep -v "<the file that defines it>"   -> non-empty
    and name the entry -> import -> import chain that reaches it.
(c) A CAPABILITY THAT WAS NEVER GRANTED. A Tauri v2 command or plugin API also needs its
    permission in ${APP}/src-tauri/capabilities/*.json. A missing permission is a RUNTIME denial
    on a build that is perfectly green. If your change touches a plugin surface, paste the
    capability entry that allows it.

BACKWARD — every symbol you STOP importing: enumerate it with its remaining importer count from
git grep -l. Any that drops to ZERO is either deleted in the same PR, or given a named future
consumer. A file left at zero importers with no written disposition FAILS the item. Dead Rust is
louder (clippy warns on unused items) but dead TypeScript is silent — check it yourself.

LIVENESS IS BLOCKING. Two independent reviewers can share a false premise: pre-flight every claim
against the CURRENT HEAD of main before you rely on it.
`

/**
 * The Drivia harness proved gating with authenticated fetches. Yap has no server and no accounts,
 * so the equivalent proof is that the behaviour is real ON THE MACHINE: a test that exercises the
 * code path, and for anything a human sees, the running app.
 */
const RUNTIME_PROOF = `
PROVING BEHAVIOUR ON A DESKTOP APP — "it compiles" is not evidence and neither is a unit test of a
function nothing calls.
For every behavioural claim, give ONE of these, and say which:
  (1) A TEST THAT FAILS WITHOUT YOUR CHANGE. Paste the test name and the raw runner output —
      'cargo test --features custom-protocol' (src-tauri), 'cargo test -p yap-polish --release'
      (sidecar, which compiles the shared protocol from the other end of the wire) or
      'npm test' (vitest, the pure frontend state machines). State that you saw it RED first if
      you can; a test that passes on unmodified main proves nothing about your diff.
  (2) THE RUNNING APP, for anything a human sees or hears. A green build is not a working UI — a
      pill that never animates, a window that opens offscreen and a hotkey that no longer fires
      all compile perfectly. Run it and look:
          cd ${dir}/${APP} && export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<your lane's target dir> && npm run desktop:dev
      Describe what you observed, and take a screenshot for any visual claim. If you could not run
      it (no display, no permission, sidecar missing), SAY SO plainly and downgrade the claim.
  (3) A COMMAND-LEVEL PROBE for plumbing: the sidecar handshake, a DB migration applied to a COPY
      of a real history file, a capability denial reproduced. Paste the raw output.
macOS PERMISSIONS ARE STATE, NOT CODE. Microphone, Accessibility and Input Monitoring grants are
keyed to the bundle id and they are already granted for the dev build; do not change the bundle id
to "clean something up" and do not reset TCC. If a claim depends on a permission, say which.
NEVER claim the DMG. 'npm run desktop:build' + notarization is minutes long and belongs to the
final smoke item, not to your gate. Your claim ceiling in the build pass is
"built, gated locally, PR open" — never "shipped", never "notarized", never "released".
`

const VERIFY_NOTHING = `
VERIFICATION THAT VERIFIES NOTHING — the whole catalogue. Read it before you claim a gate passed.
- EXIT CODES THROUGH A PIPE. 'cmd | tail' reports TAIL's status. This has already shipped a false
  green: a run recorded exit 0 on a command that exited 1. Read every code bare, or set -o pipefail.
- 'cargo check' is not 'cargo test', and 'cargo build' is not 'cargo build --release'. Name which
  one you ran. --features custom-protocol is REQUIRED for the app crate: without it you are
  building a different configuration from the one that ships.
- THE SIDECAR IS A PRECONDITION. bundle.externalBin makes the staged binary
  ${APP}/src-tauri/binaries/yap-polish-<triple> a precondition of EVERY cargo build of the app, not
  just 'tauri build'. If cargo fails looking for it, your environment is wrong, not the code:
  'cargo build -p yap-polish --release' then copy it to that path.
- 'npm run build' here IS 'tsc && vite build', so it does typecheck — but run 'npx tsc --noEmit'
  separately anyway and read both codes, because a vite plugin can mask a tsc failure and the two
  have diverged on other repos in this fleet.
- 'cargo fmt --all -- --check' FAILS ON UNMODIFIED main TODAY (exit 1, measured 2026-09-12). It is
  INFORMATIONAL in CI and it is informational here. Never present it as a gate, and never reformat
  the tree to make it green — that is a diff nobody asked for across files you did not touch.
- A WARM TARGET DIR CAN HIDE A BROKEN BUILD SCRIPT. If you changed a build.rs, a feature flag, a
  vendored dependency or anything in src-tauri/Cargo.toml, say so — and consider that the next
  cold build is the one that pays for it.
- A grep proving ABSENCE must have the right pattern AND the right scope. State both, and prove the
  pattern can match the shape you fear, not just the shape you remember.
- A merge SHA that already appears in earlier telemetry is a REPLAY. Flag it, never count it.
- A screenshot taken before the effect runs, or of a window that is not the one you changed,
  reports success on something broken for a human.

ALL EIGHT MUST EXIT 0. Run them SEPARATELY and read every code BARE, never through a pipe. The
sidecar build and its staging come BEFORE the app's cargo commands because bundle.externalBin makes
that staged binary a precondition of every cargo build of the app.
INFORMATIONAL, NOT A GATE: 'cargo fmt --all -- --check' exits 1 on unmodified main. Report it if
you ran it; never let it stop a merge, and never reformat the tree to silence it.
NOT IN THIS GATE: 'npm run desktop:build' (the DMG). It is minutes long and belongs to the final
smoke item. Do not run it here and do not claim it.
`

const MERGE_BAR = `
THE MERGE BAR — verbatim, and it is the whole job.
For EVERY blocking finding on a PR you intend to merge, you must be able to point at either
(a) a diff hunk that fixes it, or (b) evidence that refutes it. Return
blockingDispositions: [{finding, disposition: "fixed"|"refuted", evidence}]. If any blocking
finding is neither fixed nor refuted, DO NOT MERGE.

TURNING THE GATE GREEN IS NOT A DISPOSITION. This exact failure shipped a live defect on the
previous project: a reviewer raised two blocking findings — one the build could see, one it could
not (a query selecting a column that did not exist) — and the agent fixed the visible one, saw
green, and merged the functional defect into main. A compiler cannot see a wrong behaviour.

Reviewer contract: only BLOCKING findings gate a merge. FALSE CAPABILITY CLAIM stays blocking.
Advisory findings are recorded once, on THIS PR, and never re-litigated. Never open a PR to hold
advisory notes — one-PR-per-advisory is how a loop grows its own backlog with every success.

const CI_GATE = (dir, target) =>
  CI_MODE === 'local'
    ? `
CI_MODE = local — GITHUB ACTIONS CANNOT RUN, AND THE LOCAL GATE IS THE MERGE GATE.
Actions is disabled for this account by a spending limit: a run is created, its jobs are created,
and every job dies in about two seconds with an empty steps[] and no runner name. The newest run on
this repo is weeks old. So the CI check on every PR in this run WILL NEVER TURN GREEN, waiting for
it is waiting forever, and "ci-pending" is a state no PR can leave. Confirm it once, yourself:
    cd ${LOCAL_REPO} && node scripts/loop/ci-mode.mjs --why      -> prints "local" + the evidence

A PR IS LANDABLE ONLY WHEN YOU — THIS AGENT, IN THIS WORKTREE, ON THIS PR'S REBASED HEAD — HAVE
RUN THE WHOLE GATE YOURSELF AND EVERY COMMAND EXITED 0:
${GATE_CMDS(dir, target)}
SOMEONE ELSE'S GATE IS NOT YOUR GATE. A gate pasted by another agent, or on an earlier sha, or in
an earlier section of this run, is evidence about a tree that is not the one you are about to
merge. If you did not run those commands yourself on the current head, you have no gate.

NEVER MERGE ON A STALE HEAD. Bind the gate to a sha:
    cd ${dir} && git rev-parse HEAD                       # the sha your commands measured
    gh pr view -R ${REPO} <n> --json headRefOid,mergeable,mergeStateStatus
headRefOid at merge time MUST equal that sha. If you rebase, push, amend or add so much as a
comment-only commit after the gate, THE GATE IS VOID — run it all again on the new head. GitHub
must also still report mergeable == MERGEABLE (not CONFLICTING, not UNKNOWN).

THEN PASTE THE GATE ON THE PR, AS A COMMENT TITLED EXACTLY "${LOCAL_GATE_TITLE}":
    gh pr comment -R ${REPO} <n> --body "## ${LOCAL_GATE_TITLE}
ci=local — GitHub Actions cannot schedule jobs for this account, so this PR was gated locally.
gated sha: <the headRefOid you measured>
worktree:  ${dir}

typecheck=<code>
test=<code>
build=<code>
sidecar=<code>
polishtest=<code>
clippy=<code>
cargotest=<code>
fmt=<code>   (informational; 1 on unmodified main)

<the raw tail of each command's output — real pasted output, never prose>"
Post that comment BEFORE you merge. With no CI check to point at, this comment is the only
auditable record that the merge had a gate at all.

THEN MERGE:
    gh pr merge -R ${REPO} <n> --squash --delete-branch --admin
--delete-branch is not optional: an undeleted branch is the stale-branch backlog this loop's Drain
then has to sweep. Use --admin so a self-opened PR with no approving review can land.
Every merge comment and every status-board row you write carries ci=local.

OUTCOMES IN THIS MODE:
  - every command 0, sha matches, MERGEABLE -> merge. status "merged", ciCheckConclusion
    "local-gate", and localGate: {sha, typecheck, test, build, sidecar, polishtest, clippy, cargotest}.
  - any command non-zero  -> this is a red gate. Fix it if this PR is yours to fix; otherwise label
    ci-red, comment WHICH command failed with its failing output, and report status "ci-red".
    "The local gate failed" with no command name is not a triage.
  - CONFLICTING after your rebase -> label needs-rebase, status "needs-rebase".
THERE IS NO "ci-pending" IN THIS MODE. Do not return it, do not poll, do not sleep, do not run
'gh run watch' — there is no run to watch. A PR you could not gate is left OPEN with a comment
saying which command stopped you, never parked on a check that cannot arrive.
`
    : `
CI_MODE = github — THE CHECK RUN IS THE MERGE GATE (Actions has been restored).
    gh pr view -R ${REPO} <n> --json headRefOid,mergeable,mergeStateStatus
    gh api repos/${REPO}/commits/<headRefOid>/check-runs
Read the check run for the CI workflow's "Tauri build (Rust + frontend)" job whose head_sha EQUALS
headRefOid. A green check on an older sha proves nothing. A "skipped" check is not a pass and not a
failure — it is not evidence at all, so do not read it either way.
  - that job == success AND mergeable == MERGEABLE AND every blocking finding disposed
        gh pr merge -R ${REPO} <n> --squash --delete-branch --admin
    status "merged" with the squash sha; the board row carries ci=github.
  - it is queued / in_progress / not yet created -> status "ci-pending", reason "ci-pending".
    DO NOT POLL, DO NOT SLEEP, DO NOT WAIT — the land sweeper settles it.
  - it == failure -> label ci-red and comment the FAILING STEP NAME. status "ci-red".
  - mergeable == CONFLICTING after your rebase -> label needs-rebase, status "needs-rebase".
NOTE: even in this mode the CI workflow does NOT run clippy or fmt as a gate (both are '|| true'),
so a github-mode merge still owes the local clippy run. Run it and paste it.

# ═══ LAND FIRST — MERGE WHAT IS ALREADY GREEN (${CI_MODE === 'local' ? '≤ 14 TOOL CALLS, ONE PR' : '≤ 6 TOOL CALLS'}, THEN MOVE ON) ═══
Nothing else in this pass merges anything. If you skip this, the PRs pile up and every item after
you branches off a main that is missing its predecessors — which is how a loop produces fifteen
conflicting PRs and zero shipped work.

    gh pr list -R ${REPO} --state open --label ${LOOP_LABEL} --json number,headRefName,mergeable,statusCheckRollup

MERGE every PR in that list that clears the gate below, and NOTHING else. The gate depends on
whether GitHub Actions can run at all in this run; Recon has already decided, and this is it:
${CI_GATE(dir, target)}
SKIP — do not force, do not fix, do not investigate — anything pending, failing or conflicting.
NAME each one you skipped and why, in one line each. A conflicting PR is the review pass's problem,
not yours; you have an item to build.
THIS IS A BUDGET, NOT AN INVITATION: ${CI_MODE === 'local' ? 'at most 14 tool calls, and at most ONE PR gated and landed — the local gate is eight separate command runs against one worktree, so gate and land the OLDEST eligible PR, name the ones you left, and move on. The review pass settles the rest; do not try to clear the queue here' : 'at most 6 tool calls'}. Do not read diffs, do not
review, do not chase a red check. These PRs are UNREVIEWED by design and merging them gate-green
only is a decision Wilson has already made for this pass.
DO NOT TOUCH the pre-existing feat/yv1xx PRs from the previous loop unless they carry the
${LOOP_LABEL} label. They are weeks old, they are not this pass's work, and Drain triages them.

# ═══ PRE-FLIGHT — RUN THIS NEXT, BEFORE YOU BRANCH AND BEFORE YOU EDIT ONE BYTE ═══
This loop does not trust any earlier session's report that an item already shipped. So the FIRST
thing you do is try to prove this item is ALREADY DONE on unmodified main. Do it on a detached
head, so that nothing is created if it passes:

    node ${STATUS} ${p} ${tag}:preflight "pre-flight on unmodified origin/main"
    cd ${dir} && git fetch origin && git checkout --detach origin/main
    git log --oneline -1        # paste this — it is the sha your pre-flight measured

Then run the following commands VERBATIM, exactly as written, in order. Do not reinterpret them, do
not "improve" them, do not substitute an equivalent you prefer. Read every exit code BARE — never
through a pipe, which reports the LAST command's status and not the one you care about:

${item.preflight}

IF EVERY COMMAND ABOVE PASSES — the item is already done. STOP THERE.
  - Do NOT create a branch. Do NOT edit a file. Do NOT commit. Do NOT open a PR.
  - RETURN: {itemId: "${item.id}", status: "already-done", evidence: "<the RAW output of every
    pre-flight command, pasted, not summarised>", headSha: "<the sha you measured>"}
  - Your mandatory log line must contain the words "already-done" and that sha.
  The loop then skips review, fix and merge for this item and moves to the next one.

IF ANY COMMAND FAILS — the item is real work. Name the command that failed and paste what it
printed, then do everything below and return status "built".

Claiming already-done on a pre-flight you did not actually run, and claiming work on a pre-flight
that in fact passed, are both FALSE CAPABILITY CLAIMS. The reviewer treats them as blocking.

# ═══ IS THERE ALREADY AN OPEN PR FOR THIS ITEM? RESUME IT — NEVER RECREATE IT ═══
A previous run may have been killed mid-item, by a session limit or a crash. Its branch and PR are
still there, and recreating them from origin/main throws that work away and leaves a second orphan
PR behind. So, before you branch:

    gh pr list -R ${REPO} --head ${item.branch} --state open --json number,title,headRefName,url

IF THAT RETURNS AN OPEN PR — CONTINUE IT. Do not open a second one, ever.
    cd ${dir} && git fetch origin && git checkout ${item.branch} && git reset --hard origin/${item.branch}
    gh pr view -R ${REPO} <n> --json number,body,headRefOid
    gh pr view -R ${REPO} <n> --comments
    gh api repos/${REPO}/pulls/<n>/reviews
  Read the body and EVERY review comment. Address every still-OPEN BLOCKING finding — one already
  fixed in the branch's history is not open, so read the diff before you redo work. Rebase onto
  origin/main if it has drifted behind. Then re-run the item's acceptance and the GATE below, push
  to the SAME branch, and update the PR body with what you picked up and how each finding was
  disposed of. Return that number as resumedPr.
IF IT RETURNS AN EMPTY LIST — this is a fresh item. Branch as below.

# ═══ ONLY IF THE PRE-FLIGHT FAILED: BRANCH, THEN BUILD ═══
cd ${dir} && git fetch origin && git checkout -B ${item.branch} origin/main
Branch off origin/main AS IT IS RIGHT NOW — after your LAND step, which is exactly why LAND comes
first. The other lane is merging into main while you work; that is deliberate.

# THE ITEM (${item.prompt}) — quoted VERBATIM from ${SPEC_SOURCES}
${item.spec}
${item.notes ? `
# ORCHESTRATOR NOTES — decided already, do not re-decide
${item.notes}
` : ''}

# ACCEPTANCE (these exact checks must pass; put their REAL output in the PR body)
${item.acceptance}

${RUNTIME_PROOF}
${REACHABILITY}
${VERIFY_NOTHING}
${COMMIT_CONTRACT}

# MATERIAL FACTS
Yap is pre-launch: a notarized DMG exists but there is no install base to protect, so there is no
backwards-compatibility burden — build the RIGHT architecture, not the safest diff. Do not add a
feature flag; the new shape is the only shape. Do not escalate "this changes existing behaviour" as
a decision — that is the point. TWO THINGS ARE STILL IRREVERSIBLE and are never yours to change:
the bundle identifier (renaming it resets macOS TCC and the user loses Microphone / Accessibility /
Input Monitoring) and the data directory (renaming it orphans the SQLite history).

# HARD GATE BEFORE ANY PR — the whole thing, on your own branch
${GATE_CMDS(dir, target)}
If any of them fail, FIX IT — do not open a PR on a red local gate. Paste all eight codes.

# THEN
cd ${dir} && git add -A && git commit -m "${item.id}: ${item.title}" && git push -u origin ${item.branch}
gh pr create -R ${REPO} --label ${LOOP_LABEL} --title "${item.id}: ${item.title}" --body "<see below>"
The --label is REQUIRED: the next item's LAND step finds this PR by that label and nothing else, and
the review pass walks the same label. A PR without it is invisible to both and will rot.
DO NOT WAIT FOR CI. Push, open the PR, write your log line and your board row, and return. A later
item's LAND step merges this PR once it is gate-green. Sitting on 'gh run watch' is the wait this
pass exists to delete — and in this run there is no run to watch at all.

TRIAGE ALREADY ESTABLISHED: ${facts}

# THE CONTRACT — classify every finding as exactly one
BLOCKING — a real defect in shipped behaviour: a code bug; a crash or panic path; data loss in the
  local history; a permission or signing regression; audio or text leaving the machine when it
  should not; work dropped after a response closes; a LIVENESS failure (the changed code is not
  reached — a command absent from generate_handler!, a module no entry imports, a capability never
  granted); or a FALSE CAPABILITY CLAIM (the PR body says a behaviour ships when the diff shows it
  does not). Keep FALSE CAPABILITY CLAIM blocking — it is the category that catches real exposure.
ADVISORY — everything else: counts, stale line citations, prose, naming, comment wording, style,
  rustfmt drift (fmt fails on unmodified main and is informational here).
Prefix every finding with "BLOCKING: " or "ADVISORY: ".
A PR merges with ZERO blocking findings no matter how many advisory ones.

# WHAT TO ATTACK HARDEST
1. REACHABILITY / LIVENESS. Run the greps yourself. Is the changed code actually reached? A
   previous session shipped five fixes into dead modules that passed every gate.
2. EVIDENCE CLASS. Did the author prove behaviour with a test that fails without the change, with
   the running app, or with a probe — or only with "it compiles"? A green build is not a working
   UI, and this app's defects are overwhelmingly runtime ones: hotkeys, window placement, timers,
   permissions, sidecar handshakes.
3. Does the diff match what the PR body says it does? Diff the claim against the code.
4. Did it break a surface it did not mention — the float/pill window, the main window, the tray,
   the updater, the sidecar protocol, the DB schema?
5. HAS MAIN MOVED UNDER IT? Check whether the PR is now redundant, contradicted by, or duplicated
   on origin/main. Say so explicitly — that is a real outcome.

${RUNTIME_PROOF}

If you return BLOCK you MUST return a non-empty blocking[] array. A BLOCK with an empty blocking[]
is malformed; it is recorded as a PASS with an advisory note and you will NOT be re-dispatched, so
a finding you fail to write down is a finding you did not make.

A primary adversarial reviewer is reviewing it right now. ITS VERDICT IS HIDDEN FROM YOU BY DESIGN.
Do not ask for it, do not guess it, do not try to agree with it. Two reviewers that share a premise
are one reviewer: this harness has already shipped a dead-code fix that TWO independent reviewers
both approved, because both accepted the same false premise. You exist to break that.

Read it: gh pr view -R ${REPO} ${pr} --json number,title,body,headRefOid,files
and gh pr diff -R ${REPO} ${pr}. Read-only greps in ${dir}; never check out a branch there.
TRIAGE ALREADY ESTABLISHED: ${facts}

# THE CONTRACT — identical to the primary reviewer's. BLOCKING vs ADVISORY, prefix every finding.
# YOUR FOUR LENSES — the primary reviewer is NOT asked for these. Spend your effort HERE.
(a) LIVENESS / FALSE PREMISE. Is the code this PR touches actually REACHED at runtime on current
    HEAD? Name the chain: HTML entry -> import -> symbol, or invoke() -> generate_handler! ->
    command. If you cannot name that chain, the change is dead code and that is BLOCKING.
(b) FAILURE POLARITY. For EVERY guard, permission check, capability, unwrap, expect and Result
    branch in the diff, state which way it fails. What happens when the input is None, an empty
    string, a denied permission, a missing sidecar binary, a closed window or an Err? Does any
    catch/unwrap_or return a PERMISSIVE or FABRICATED value (true, an empty transcript treated as
    success, a silently swallowed error)? A path that fails OPEN, or that panics on the main
    thread, is BLOCKING even when the happy path is correct. Quote the exact expression and write
    "fails open", "fails closed" or "panics" for each one.
(c) LOCAL DATA AND PERMISSION INTEGRITY. For every SQLite migration, schema change, file write,
    keychain access, capability edit or tauri.conf change, say what breaks for: a fresh install, an
    existing install with history, an install whose permissions were granted to the current bundle
    id, and an install mid-update. An unbounded UPDATE/DELETE, a dropped column still read by
    shipped code, a migration that cannot run twice, a widened capability, and ANY change to the
    bundle identifier or the data directory are all BLOCKING.
(d) CLAIMS VS DIFF. Every sentence in the PR body containing "verified", "proven", "confirmed",
    "tested" or a pasted number MUST map to raw output pasted in the PR. A claim with no raw output
    behind it is a FALSE CAPABILITY CLAIM and is BLOCKING. An exit code read through a pipe is the
    exit code of the LAST command in the pipe, so evidence piped into tail/grep proves nothing.
${RUNTIME_PROOF}
${VERIFY_NOTHING}

If you cannot read the PR at all (gh fails, the PR is missing), return status "unavailable" with
verdict "PASS" — NEVER BLOCK on your own inability to review. "unavailable" never blocks a merge.

Evaluating checks on a stale head is how this loop has failed before — a conflict is an artifact of
loop duration, not a defect in the work, so RESOLVE it; the work is yours to carry, not to abandon.
IF THE REBASE SHOWS THE PR IS ALREADY IN MAIN (empty after rebase, or its change is present on
origin/main by another route): do NOT force it through. CLOSE it with the evidence —
    gh pr close -R ${REPO} ${pr} --comment "superseded by <sha/PR#> on main: <evidence>"
— and return status "closed-superseded". A superseded PR closed with evidence is a WIN, not a miss.
After a rebase push use git push --force-with-lease, NEVER a plain --force.

verdicts on it, and if there is a BLOCKING defect open a follow-up PR and say so plainly.

Fix ONLY the BLOCKING findings. Do NOT address advisory findings — they are logged once and never
re-litigated. Do NOT expand scope. If you believe a blocking finding is WRONG, do not silently drop
it: post a PR comment with the evidence that refutes it. A reviewer being wrong is a legitimate
outcome; a finding quietly dropped is not.
${MERGE_BAR}
blockingDispositions is REQUIRED in your return, one entry per blocking finding raised by either
reviewer. If any blocking finding is neither fixed nor refuted: do NOT merge, leave the PR open,
    gh pr edit -R ${REPO} ${pr} --add-label needs-human
and comment exactly which finding stopped you. THERE IS NO SECOND REVIEW ROUND IN THIS PASS: a
finding you cannot dispose of ends as needs-human, never as a re-dispatch.

Post them even when every verdict is PASS. A verdict that lives only in a loop log is unauditable
from GitHub. Advisory findings go in a comment on THIS PR — never a new PR; one-PR-per-advisory is
how a loop grows its own backlog with every success.

Rust build cache once per lane, you make sure the ${LOOP_LABEL} label exists, and you MEASURE
whether GitHub Actions can run at all. Do not build anything. Do not open a PR. Each item's own
pre-flight is that item's job, never yours.

# 1 — CREATE BOTH LANE WORKTREES (not clones — they share the object store, which is the disk win)
    lane A  ${WORKDIR}      port ${PREVIEW_PORT}   CARGO_TARGET_DIR ${CARGO_TARGET_A}
    lane B  ${WORKDIR_B}    port ${PREVIEW_PORT_B} CARGO_TARGET_DIR ${CARGO_TARGET_B}

    cd ${LOCAL_REPO} && git fetch origin
    git worktree add ${WORKDIR} -b yap/recon-a origin/main
    git worktree add ${WORKDIR_B} -b yap/recon-b origin/main
If either already exists from an earlier attempt or an earlier PART, do NOT blindly delete it: check
'git worktree list', and REUSE it if it is clean. Say for each which you did. If the branch name is
already taken, reuse the existing worktree rather than inventing a third one.
Confirm and paste, for EACH: git log --oneline -1 && git status --porcelain

# 2 — INSTALL ONCE PER LANE (the app lives in ${APP}/, never at the repo root)
    cd ${WORKDIR}/${APP} && npm ci --cache ${NPM_CACHE}
    cd ${WORKDIR_B}/${APP} && npm ci --cache ${NPM_CACHE}
If a lane's node_modules already exists (from an earlier part) and 'npm ls --depth 0' is healthy,
say so and SKIP that install — the worktrees are deliberately left standing between parts.

# 3 — WARM THE RUST CACHE ONCE PER LANE. THIS IS THE EXPENSIVE STEP AND IT IS PAID HERE, ONCE.
src-tauri statically links transcribe-cpp's ggml and yap-polish vendors llama-cpp-sys-2: a COLD
build of this workspace is MINUTES. The target dirs live OUTSIDE the worktrees on purpose, so this
cache survives every item, every part and both passes. For EACH lane, with that lane's target dir:
    cd ${WORKDIR}/${APP} && export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${CARGO_TARGET_A}
    cargo build -p yap-polish --release ; echo "sidecarA=$?"
    TRIPLE="$(rustc -vV | awk '/^host:/ {print $2}')" ; mkdir -p src-tauri/binaries && cp ${CARGO_TARGET_A}/release/yap-polish "src-tauri/binaries/yap-polish-$TRIPLE" ; echo "stageA=$?"
    cd ${WORKDIR}/${APP}/src-tauri && cargo build --release --features custom-protocol ; echo "appA=$?"
and the same for lane B with ${WORKDIR_B} and ${CARGO_TARGET_B}.
STAGING THE SIDECAR IS NOT OPTIONAL: bundle.externalBin makes that binary a precondition of EVERY
cargo build of the app, so a missing one fails the build for ENVIRONMENT reasons and a later agent
will waste an hour reading it as a code defect.

# 4 — BASELINE GATE, ONCE, IN LANE A ONLY (both lanes sit on the same origin/main sha)
${GATE_CMDS(WORKDIR, CARGO_TARGET_A)}
Plus the informational one, so the run knows its baseline:
    cd ${WORKDIR}/${APP} && cargo fmt --all -- --check ; echo "fmt=$?"
MEASURED ON main 2026-09-12: typecheck=0 test=0 build=0 sidecar=0 polishtest=0 clippy=0 cargotest=0
and fmt=1. If any of the eight is non-zero for you, report it as the BASELINE state; do not fix it,
and do not let a later agent be blamed for it. Do NOT repeat the baseline in lane B — confirm the
two shas match instead.

# 4b — THE LABEL AND THE BOARD
Every PR this loop opens carries the ${LOOP_LABEL} label — the LAND step and the review pass both
find PRs by it and by nothing else. Create it once if it is absent, and say which:
    gh label list -R ${REPO} --search ${LOOP_LABEL}
    gh label create ${LOOP_LABEL} -R ${REPO} --color BFD4F2 --description "opened by the Yap overhaul loop; unreviewed until the review pass" || true
Then seed the run's status board (it is safe to re-run; it upserts):
    node ${STATUS} --part ${PART} --total ${ITEMS.length} --current none

# 5 — IS CI ALIVE? THIS DECIDES THE MERGE GATE FOR EVERY LATER AGENT IN THIS RUN
    cd ${LOCAL_REPO} && node scripts/loop/ci-mode.mjs --why
That script asks GitHub whether the newest pull_request-triggered run in the last 24 h actually
placed a job on a runner. It prints "github" or "local" on line 1 and the evidence on line 2.
PASTE BOTH LINES VERBATIM and return them as ciMode and ciModeWhy. Do not guess, do not infer from
a red check, and do not "fix" a local verdict. THE EXPECTED ANSWER IS "local": Actions is disabled
account-wide by a spending limit and the newest run on this repo is weeks old. local means the whole
run merges on a pasted local gate instead. Getting this one field wrong parks every PR of the run
on a check that will never report.
Also record the starting state, from gh and not from branch names:
    gh pr list -R ${REPO} --state open --json number,title,headRefName,labels
There are pre-existing open feat/yv1xx PRs from a previous loop. They are NOT this pass's work and
they do NOT carry the ${LOOP_LABEL} label: count them, name them, and leave them alone. Drain
triages them at the end of the run.

# 6 — PER-ITEM PRE-FLIGHT IS NOT YOURS TO RUN
Each build agent runs its own item.preflight against unmodified origin/main and short-circuits the
item to "already-done" when every command passes. Do NOT run the items' pre-flights here: a
pre-flight run by recon and reported second-hand is exactly the shared-false-premise failure this

    `TRIAGE for the REVIEW PASS of ${REPO}. ONE job: turn the open ${LOOP_LABEL} PRs into an ordered
queue, and close the ones that should never be reviewed at all. You review nothing, fix nothing and
merge nothing — two review chains do that immediately after you, driven by what you return.

# 1 — ENUMERATE
    gh pr list -R ${REPO} --state open --label ${LOOP_LABEL} --limit 200 --json number,title,headRefName,headRefOid,mergeable,createdAt,files
    gh pr list -R ${REPO} --state merged --limit 200 --json number,title,headRefName,mergeCommit
ALSO list the open PRs WITHOUT the ${LOOP_LABEL} label and report them separately, untouched: the
feat/yv1xx PRs predate this loop. They are Drain's problem, not this queue's.

# 2 — THE REAL CHECK STATE, PER PR. THE STATUS API LIES TO YOU HERE.
For each open PR:
    gh api repos/${REPO}/commits/<headRefOid>/check-runs
Take the check run for the CI workflow whose head_sha EQUALS that PR's headRefOid and whose run was
triggered by the pull_request event. A "skipped" check is NOT a pass and NOT a failure — it is not
evidence, and reading it either way is how a previous run reported CI state it had never measured.
Record ci as one of: success | failure | pending | none (no run exists at this head yet). On this
repo the expected answer is "none" for every PR, because Actions is disabled by a spending limit —
report that plainly rather than as a per-PR anomaly.
Do not use gh pr checks and do not use /status — both report pending states that never resolve.

# 3 — DUPLICATES AND SUPERSEDED. DO THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ENTERS THE QUEUE.
Every PR title starts with an ITEM ID. Extract it.
  (a) If an item id already appears on a MERGED PR, the open one is SUPERSEDED. Verify it for real
      — read the merged diff, confirm the open PR's change is present on origin/main — then close
      it: gh pr close -R ${REPO} <n> --comment "superseded by #<merged PR> (<sha>): <evidence>"
  (b) If TWO OR MORE open PRs carry the same item id, keep the NEWEST by createdAt and close the
      rest, naming the survivor: "duplicate of #<survivor>, which is newer and supersedes this".
Never close a PR without naming what replaces it. "Triaged" with no outcome is not an outcome.
Report every close in closed[].

# 4 — CLASSIFY
klass = "security" if ANY of these is true, else "standard":
  - the PR touches ${SECURITY_PATHS}
  - its title's item id matches ${SECURITY_IDS}
A security PR gets a SECOND reviewer with a liveness / failure-polarity / data-and-permission lens,
and therefore costs two of the run's three agent seats at once. Classify honestly: over-classifying
halves this pass's throughput, under-classifying is how a permission or signing regression ships.
Also record size: files (count) and additions (count) from the PR json.

# 5 — WRITE THE QUEUE DOC
mkdir -p the dir, then write ${REVIEW_QUEUE_DOC}: a markdown table with one row per open PR —
PR | item | klass | ci | mergeable | files | additions | createdAt | disposition (queued/closed+why).
Put the closed ones in a second table below it, and the unlabelled pre-existing PRs in a third.
This file is what Wilson reads to see the plan.

# 6 — RETURN THE ORDER
queue[] is ordered: EVERY security PR first (oldest createdAt first inside that group), then every
standard PR by createdAt ASCENDING. Oldest-first inside each group because an old PR has the most
main under it and the most rebase debt — settle it before it rots further.
Do NOT include a PR you closed. Do NOT include a PR that gh reports as already MERGED. Do NOT
include a PR that lacks the ${LOOP_LABEL} label.

RETURN exactly: {queue: [{pr, item, title, headRefName, klass, ci, mergeable, files, additions}],

failing command, the failing output, and — from 'git log --oneline' on the merges of this pass —
which merge most likely introduced it. Do NOT fix it silently; report it as a LIVE DEFECT and open
a follow-up PR if the fix is small and obvious.

For each MERGED one, re-run its own acceptance probe against main's head and paste the raw output:
the capability entry, the generate_handler! grep, the migration applied to a COPY of a history file,
the sidecar handshake, the updater signature check — whichever that item's acceptance named.

A green workspace build is not a running app. Launch it from main's head and say what you saw:
    cd ${REVIEW_DIRS[0]}/${APP} && export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${REVIEW_TARGETS[0]} && npm run desktop:dev
Confirm: the main window renders, the float/pill window appears, the dictation hotkey fires, and the
sidecar answers. Screenshot anything visual. If you could not launch it (no display, permission
prompt, sidecar missing), SAY SO plainly and mark the claim unverified — never imply you ran it.
Kill it before you return and confirm nothing listens on ${REVIEW_PORTS[0]}.

# 5 — THE DMG, ONLY IF ASKED
${(typeof args !== 'undefined' && args && args.dmg) ? `args.dmg IS SET, so build the bundle once from main's head and report its path and size:
    cd ${REVIEW_DIRS[0]}/${APP} && export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${REVIEW_TARGETS[0]} && npm run desktop:build ; echo "dmg=$?"
This takes minutes. Do NOT notarize and do NOT publish anything — a local bundle that builds is the
claim, nothing further.` : `args.dmg is NOT set, so DO NOT build the DMG. It is minutes long, it is

   not read a title's own annotation as live state — that mistake has produced a wrong count in
   four consecutive recorded runs on the sibling project.
2. TRIAGE EVERY OPEN PR, not only the ones this pass created. For each: merge / rebase-then-merge /
   close-as-superseded WITH EVIDENCE. If a PR is blocked by a defect you can fix in a few minutes,
   FIX IT — drain agents that fix rather than report are what took a 19-PR queue to 1 in one run.
   REPORT-ONLY FOR THIS RUN'S OWN UNREVIEWED PRs. Every PR labelled ${LOOP_LABEL} whose body starts
   with "${UNREVIEWED_PREFIX}" is waiting for the REVIEW PASS, not for you. Do NOT merge one that is
   conflicting or red, and do not review one yourself: list them with their mergeStateStatus and
   leave them open. A build-mode LAND step merges the green ones; the review pass settles the rest.
   THE PRE-EXISTING feat/yv1xx PRs ARE YOURS TO SETTLE, AND THIS IS THE RUN THAT SETTLES THEM.
   They are weeks old, they carry no ${LOOP_LABEL} label, and nothing has closed them in four
   sessions. For EACH: rebase onto main and merge it if it still makes sense and the gate is green,
   or CLOSE it with the evidence that supersedes it (name the sha or PR on main that did the work,
   or state plainly that the work was abandoned). "Still open, stale" is not an outcome. A stale PR
   nobody closes is the backlog that grows with every run.

${MERGE_BAR}
   Enumerate every blocking finding and its disposition in your returned payload as
   blockingDispositions: [{finding, disposition: "fixed"|"refuted", evidence}].
   If ANY blocking finding is neither fixed nor refuted, DO NOT MERGE — leave the PR open and say

   (git bundle create ${LOCAL_REPO}/.loop-archive/<name>.bundle <branch> --not origin/main). The
   remote has stale feat/yv1xx and fix/* branches; most are ancestors of main.

   how much merged. Say so plainly.

  item id, class, primary verdict, independent verdict (security PRs only — say plainly that a
  standard PR got ONE reviewer by design, never imply a second), whether it needed a fix round, and
  its terminal state (merged / ci-pending→swept / ci-red / needs-rebase / needs-human /
  closed-superseded). Then: did the 3-agent cap hold? How long did a standard PR take end to end
  versus a security PR? Did MAIN VERIFY find a LIVE DEFECT, and if so which merge introduced it?
- THE GATE THIS PASS ACTUALLY USED. CI_MODE was ${CI_MODE}, resolved by Recon with
  scripts/loop/ci-mode.mjs${(recon && typeof recon === 'object' && recon.ciModeWhy) ? ` — evidence: ${recon.ciModeWhy}` : ''}.
${CI_MODE === 'local'
  ? `  COUNT THE LOCAL-GATE MERGES FROM GITHUB, NOT FROM THE PAYLOAD. A merge that landed on the local
  gate carries a PR comment titled "${LOCAL_GATE_TITLE}":
      gh pr list -R ${REPO} --state merged --label ${LOOP_LABEL} --limit 100 --json number,title,mergedAt
      gh pr view -R ${REPO} <n> --json comments      # per PR: does a "${LOCAL_GATE_TITLE}" comment exist?
  Call that count N, then write this sentence into the section VERBATIM with N substituted and
  nothing softened, hedged or reworded:
      "CI was unavailable (Actions disabled by the account spending limit); N PRs merged on the
       local gate; re-run CI on main when restored: gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main"
  Then list all N by number with their pasted exit codes (typecheck, test, build, sidecar,
  polishtest, clippy, cargotest) and the gated sha. And name every PR this pass merged that has NO
  such comment: that is a merge with no gate at all, and it is a FINDING at the top of the section,
  not a footnote. Finally: state plainly that main has not been through CI since before this loop,
  so the first thing to do when Actions is restored is 'gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main' and read
  the result before trusting the merged tree.`
  : `  CI ran normally this pass: every merge was gated by the CI check run on the PR's own head sha.
  Say so explicitly rather than leaving it unstated — and note that CI treats clippy and fmt as
  informational, so name which merges also carry a local clippy run.`}
- LANE BALANCE: how many items each lane got, and whether one lane finished long before the other
  (that is the lane assignment to fix next run, not a defect).
- DISK: the target-dir sizes and free space Drain reported, and whether every worktree and target
  dir this run created is actually gone (or deliberately kept for the next part).
- Which harness guards actually FIRED versus passed vacuously. Name them individually: the
  pre-flight already-done short-circuit, the reachability gate (generate_handler! / entry import /
  capability), the runtime-proof requirement, the malformed-BLOCK recording, the merge bar's
  blockingDispositions, the 3-agent semaphore, the worktree teardown.
- 2-3 concrete refinements for the next wave, and any standing chore still unshipped with how many
  runs it has now survived.

# CLOSE THE BOARD
For every item in the payload whose outcome is terminal (merged, already-done, or reviewed+merged),
mark it done on the board, then close the header:
    node ${STATUS} <itemId> harness:done "<one clause: the outcome>"
    node ${STATUS} --part ${PART} --total ${ITEMS.length} --current none
The board is ${STATUS_BOARD} and it is what Wilson reads; leaving an item showing "build" forever
after it merged is a false green.
